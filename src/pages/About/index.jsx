              My name is Isabel K. Lee and I’m a full-stack developer. I go by they/them pronouns
              and have a background in design and product strategy. I really enjoy working on design
              systems, web applications, and early- to mid-stage startups.

              Before I started my tech career, I studied Middle East foreign policy and philosophy
              in Montreal. I care deeply about political activism, cooking for others, and taking
              care of my large, adult son, Finklestein (he's actually a cat).
