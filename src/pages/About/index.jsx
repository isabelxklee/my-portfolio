            Hello, fellow Internet surfer! Thank you for visiting my corner of
            the web. ðŸŒž

            My name is Isabel K. Lee and Iâ€™m a full-stack developer. I go by
            they/them pronouns and have a background in design and product
            strategy. I really enjoy working on design systems, web
            applications, and early- to mid-stage startups.
          </P>
          <P>
            Before I started my tech career, I studied Middle East foreign
            policy and philosophy in Montreal. I care deeply about political
            activism, cooking for others, and taking care of my large, adult
            son, Finklestein (he's actually a cat).
          </P>
          <P>Letâ€™s build something together!</P>
